## Creativity

1. In order to engage your reader in a story, you must clarify the problem that the story revolves around. (In traditional narrative, this is called the **conflict**.) Every story revolves around a problem: the story ends when the problem is solved. 

   Your first essay doesn't mention the problem until the second paragraph, and even then, only weakly. You need to sell ads for your newspaper, yes, but why? What are the stakes? 
   
   For such a short essay, this is where your story should begin: what is the problem, and why does it matter? Movies and books may tease the reader with a cryptic opening scene (this is a classic technique called _in media res_), but you don't have time for that. Start strong:
   
   > In the face of recent budget cuts, Temple City High School's journalism
   > program has turned to more advertising for desperately needed revenue —
   > printing newspapers costs money, after all. Program advisor Chuck Terence
   > has put the pressure on the editorial team to go out into the community in
   > search of support, but most businesses we've gone to have turned us away.
   > But then, I had an idea...

2. Also note how I introduced this character: first, by mentioning "Temple City High School's journalism program", then referring to him as "program advisor chuck terence". Without that first part, the second part would be very confusing. Compare that to your essay, which begins, "Don, the editor-in-chief, and I, the business manager..." The reader is already trying to figure out what's happening in the story, but is now also asking himself, editor-in-chief and business manager of what? Remember, your reader is tired and cranky; make it easy to follow along.

3. The example of creativity that you provide — the idea for running an ad and a story side-by-side — that's golden. You want to emphasize that this was the act of creativity that your essay is about, but of course, you have to balance that against sounding humble. Instead of just coming out with "So you see, this is how creative I am," use this opportunity to extend your story and bring it back to the original question (which mentions the many ways creativity can be expressed):

   > Ironically, I had first joined the journalism team to grow myself
   > artistically, through doing graphic design — but in the end, my biggest
   > contribution to the program was through a very different kind of creativity.

## Challenges

The raw honesty is good, but don't forget to answer the question!

> Describe the most significant challenge you have faced **and the steps you
> have taken to overcome this challenge. How has this challenge affected your
> academic achievement?**

## An Academic Subject That Inspires You

Damn dude, shit got real with this one. This actually seems like it would tie in very well with the _Challenges_ essay. Obviously they have to stand on their own as two separate essays, but you could hint at the themes you bring up in your previous essay, with the pressures of academic performance in a Chinese immigrant household.

This essay packs a punch. If anything, I would suggest two things:

1. Emphasize the critical line: 

   > “Have confidence! Don’t erase your lines so easily, there are no mistakes
   > in art.”
   > There are no mistakes. That's a powerful thing to say to a third-grader
   > with a crippling fear of failure.

2. Clarify your message about mistakes. The message appears to be, as Bob Ross would say,

   ![We don’t make mistakes — we just have happy accidents.](https://i.giphy.com/media/e3tF1DncWgasM/200_s.gif)
   
   But then in the next paragraph, the traditional attitude shows through in the language you use:
   
   > Using my creativity and innovation, I corrected any “mistakes”.
   
   You put "mistakes" in quotation marks here, hinting that they're not actually mistakes (which, I think, is good). So then what does it mean to correct them? If you've truly taken this message to heart, should "mistakes" be "corrected", or should they be approached differently altogether?
   
   > As time flows, the meaning of mistakes changed for me. They are not proof
   > of failures, but chances to learn. For each mistakes steer me in a better
   > direction. 
   
   This is a powerful message, but at least to me, still a little different from "there are no mistakes." Like, if there are no mistakes, why are we talking about how you approach your mistakes and what mistakes mean? Why are you _consuming knowledge_ on drawing techniques? (I'd argue that when your goal is to learn a technique, mistakes are a very real thing.)
   
   Perhaps we should say, if these things I did are not mistakes, then what are they instead?
   
   Think on that and tell me if it means anything to you. Perhaps you are not fully willing to let go of your traditional attitudes about correctness and technical learning (shape, value, color, edge), but Mrs. Chu's attitude has given you some freedom from your own harsh self-criticism?

And to answer your question, I think you can make your essay shorter by removing some of the flowery sentences. Don't remove all of them, but for example, your essay would not lose much if you took out the last two sentences of your second paragraph. If you're still very tight on space, try to work your pursuit of art into the existing messages:

> I continued to pursue painting in middle school, learning how to use shape,
> value, color and edge to create illusion of objects. In high school, I
> brought those same lessons to other forms of art — photography in particular
> — as I spent more and more of my free time experimenting with light, form,
> texture, and space.

## A Strong Candidate for Admission

Here, I would say the same thing as I did for the _Challenges_ essay: don't forget to answer the question.

Beyond what has already been shared in your application, **what do you believe makes you stand out** as a strong candidate for admissions to the University of California?

In this essay, you talk about your grandfather and your father. The most you say about yourself is that you're eager to learn and you see it as a duty. I don't doubt that you possess these qualities, but I don't think they are particularly unique to you. So the question is, what makes you stand out?

This is a hard question to answer, because while every person is unique, from the perspective of a college admissions officer, they're mostly the same. You probably don't want to harp too much on your immigrant background and the Confucian tradition of scholarliness here; about 40% of the student body at UCLA is Asian, so that is decidedly _not_ a place where you stand out.

Think hard on this one. I wouldn't blame you if you couldn't come up with any ways that you're really different from the rest (in a way that's meaningful to a UC admissions officer), but if that's the case, you might want to choose a different prompt.
